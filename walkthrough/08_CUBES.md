* Download one texture for the cube (save the image):

| Texture 1                      | Texture 2                      | Texture 3                      |

* Drag the downloaded texture in the `Textures` folder. A texture is an image straight out of an image processing program like Photoshop:

* Drag the texture from the folder on the cube:

You see now that a new material is created automatically. A material is the details of what an object should look like including albedo, emission, reflections etc:
