# 3. Scene View
The `Scene view` is where you will visually construct your game. And this can be navigated by making use of the buttons above the view.

*	The first button, the `Hand Tool`, is purely for navigating. With this tool selected drag with the left mouse button to pan, and with the right mouse button to look around first person style (WASD). With any object selected in the hierarchy you can focus on the object by double clicking the object's name.
* The remaining three buttons allow you adjust position, rotation and scale of objects.
